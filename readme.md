How to build PunyMCE
---------------------

In the root directory of PunyMCE where the build.xml file is you can run ant against different targets.

`ant`

Will combine, preprocess and minify the PunyMCE puny_mce_src.js into puny_mce.js and all plugins etc into puny_mce_full.js.

`ant moxiedoc`

Will generate API Documentation for the project using the Moxiedoc tool. The docs will be generated to the docs/api directory.

`ant release`

Will produce an release package of the current repository code. The release packages will be placed in the export directory.
